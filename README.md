## About

Kaidan is a simple, user-friendly Jabber/XMPP client providing a modern user-interface
using [Kirigami](https://techbase.kde.org/Kirigami) and [QtQuick](http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Quick).
The back-end of Kaidan is completely written in C++ using the [Swiften](http://swift.im/swiften.html)
Library of the [Swift Instant Messenger](http://swift.im/swift.html) and [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io/).

Currently Kaidan only has been tested on GNU/Linux Desktops, but because of the use of Qt we shouldn't have
any problems porting it to all other common platforms, even Android. Nevertheless we will work on another
GUI using Silica for better look & feel on Sailfish OS soon (See [KaidanSF](https://github.com/KaidanIM/KaidanSF)).
But if you want to get a client for Sailfish OS _now_, maybe take a look at
[Shmoose](https://github.com/geobra/harbour-shmoose), a fork by an earlier developer of Kaidan.

Kaidan is NOT finished at all and we still have much to do!
