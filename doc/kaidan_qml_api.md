# Kaidan QML API documentation

This is the documentation of all functions and classes accessible from the
QML-side of the XMPP client Kaidan. This can be helpful, if you want to write a
new GUI for it as [KaidanSF](https://github.com/kaidanim/kaidansf).

## Main QML library - `io.github.kaidanim`

Use this to import the main Kaidan QML-library:
```qml
import io.github.kaidanim 1.0
```

This will be needed to use all registered QML types of Kaidan.
